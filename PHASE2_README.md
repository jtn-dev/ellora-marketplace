- **Automatic Fund Release**: Payments released when work is approved
- **Dispute Resolution**: Decentralized jury system for conflicts
- **Multi-Signature Security**: Enhanced transaction security

### 🏆 **Reputation System (SBT)**
- **Soulbound Tokens**: Non-transferable reputation tokens
- **On-Chain Reputation**: Immutable track record stored on Algorand
- **Juror Eligibility**: High-reputation users can resolve disputes
- **Rating System**: 5-star rating system with weighted scores

### 💼 **Enhanced Job Management**
- **Blockchain-Verified Jobs**: All jobs backed by smart contracts
- **Real-Time Status Tracking**: Monitor job progress on-chain
- **Automated Workflows**: Smart contract-driven job lifecycle
- **Transparent Payments**: All transactions visible on Algorand

## 🏗 **Technical Architecture**

### Smart Contracts

#### 1. **Escrow Contract** (`escrow_contract.py`)
```python
# Core functionalities:
- create_job()      # Client creates job with payment
- accept_job()      # Freelancer accepts the job
- complete_job()    # Freelancer marks job complete
- approve_completion() # Client approves and releases funds
- raise_dispute()   # Either party can dispute
- vote_dispute()    # Jurors vote on disputes
```

#### 2. **Reputation SBT Contract** (`reputation_sbt.py`)
```python
# Core functionalities:
- mint_sbt()        # Award reputation tokens
- update_rating()   # Update user ratings
- check_eligibility() # Check if user can be juror
- get_reputation()  # Get user's reputation score
```

### Frontend Integration

#### New Components:
- **JobCreationModal**: Create jobs with smart contract integration
- **ContractService**: Interact with Algorand smart contracts
- **Enhanced Dashboard**: Real-time blockchain data
- **Reputation Display**: Show on-chain reputation scores

## 🔧 **Installation & Setup**

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ (for PyTEAL)
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend)
- Algorand Testnet account with ALGO

### 1. Install Smart Contract Dependencies
```bash
# Install PyTEAL and Algorand SDK
pip3 install pyteal py-algorand-sdk

# Verify installation
python3 -c "import pyteal; print('PyTEAL installed successfully')"
```

### 2. Smart Contract Development
```bash
# Navigate to smart contracts directory
cd smart-contracts/contracts

# Compile contracts (generates TEAL code)
python3 escrow_contract.py
python3 reputation_sbt.py
```

### 3. Deploy to Algorand Testnet
```bash
# Get testnet ALGO from dispenser
# Visit: https://testnet.algoexplorer.io/dispenser

# Deploy contracts
cd ../scripts
python3 deploy_contracts.py
```

### 4. Update Frontend Configuration
```typescript
// After deployment, update contract IDs in contractService.ts
const TESTNET_CONFIG: ContractConfig = {
  escrowAppId: YOUR_ESCROW_APP_ID,    // From deployment
  sbtAppId: YOUR_SBT_APP_ID,          // From deployment
  network: 'testnet'
};
